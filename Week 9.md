Working with Hydra was super cool. I'm trying to create differenet textures? Not really the right word, but I think just layering a lot of different things and
seeing what kind of textures and movements come out of it is super cool. It almost feels like a weird extension of your fingers because you can see the code change
in live time. I like using Hydra vs. p5.js because it feels really interactive and not too difficult. Like you can do a lot with a small list of functions versus 
having a lot of different functions to choose from with p5.js and feeling overwhelmed. Hydra would definitely be good for live coding with sounds, and I think it 
could be really fun to use for our live coding performance. 

I found this [live coding performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjmmDvLkT0) on youtube thats really interesting.
