For my inspiration for this project, I was really inpsired by vintage music visualizers like the Atari one and also the iTunes music visualizer. Quarantine was 
really hard for me, and listening to music was the one thing that kept me sane when I was forced to be on my computer for all hours of the day doing class. I want
this to make the user feel relaxed, and allow them to clear their mind while they watch my shapes change based on their music. My main concept with this was to 
allow the user to not only listen to the music and view the visualizer, but to be able to drift off and leave the daunting tasks of the day behind. This project
changed a lot since I began working on it. I was able to build my code up from scratch and really understand it. Although it may look simple, I'm really proud of 
how hard I worked on this and how well I understand the code, which isn't something I could say for all of the projects I've done in this class. I played around 
with trying different shapes and colors, but the final result is something that I think is beautiful in it's simplicity. I actually started with something extremely
complex, but it was found open source code and felt too overwhelming for me to build on it when I didn't understand the initial code. I'm much happer with my final
product.
