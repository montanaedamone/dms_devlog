## Monty Damone - Week 7 DMS Code
[My Sketch HW For This Week](https://editor.p5js.org/montdemon/sketches/Ss-8RBkJe)

I'm really struggling with the physics portion of this class. Its hard because there are no current tutors who know p5.js, so im really trying to teach myself, but I think I will need to come to office hours to go over my code really maticulously (I hope I spelled that right lol). Anyway, I really like coding in TidalCycles. I think making digital code music is an interesting idea, and it was really fun to jam with some of my classmates. I think its gonna take some practice to get really good at it and learn what each function does, but I'm definitely gonna continue jamming. I've always wanted to experiment with something like this, so last week's lesson was super great.  Here are some screenshots:

I also really liked these base code snippets, which I can build off of: 

--sound "arpy*4" # up "a b e"

--sound "bd:5 [cp, sd] bd:5 [cp, sd]"
