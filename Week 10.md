## Monty Damone - Week 10 DMS Code

[My Group's Final Game Sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/montdemon/sketches/jTdIc8w1P)

This project was interesting because I hadn't done group work in a while and had forgotten what it's like. I felt kind of all over the place with this project because everyone in my group was pretty good at writing and understanding the code and I felt very behind, so I tried to help where I could with the graphics and whatnot, but it was still difficult for me because I wanted to contribute just as much as everyone else, but was struggling. It showed me that I need to re-teach myself some aspects the code in a way that makes sense to me, though, because it makes sense to me when I'm showed how to do it, but really struggle with the writing on my own. I was stressed about not being able to gather my group to finish the  project, but I didn't realize they had been working on it individually, so it all ended up being okay. The eating function was the most difficult part of the project and for the final version, I don't really think we were able to hash that part out. I wish I could say that I contributed a lot to this project, but it mostly showed me how behind I am and how much I have 
to learn, as I'm having a lot of trouble with the math/physics part of it, which we really needed for this project. Brock, Quincy, and Chris really did a great job.
I did code this squirrel, though, which we didn't even end up using lol.
